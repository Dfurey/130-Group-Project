# 130-Group-Project
This repo is for our CYSE 130 group project. This repo contains our diagrams, scripts, documentation, and results in their respective folders. 

# Overview
This is a mock cybersecurity system for a hypothetical organization. Our goal was to apply the concepts we have learned in class in practice. To accomplish this, we are using systems engineering principles, UML modeling, automation using Python, data analytics, and some risk management.

# Installation
The only useful files worth actually downloading would be our Automation.ipynb notebook as well as the Windows_2k.log_structured.csv sample logs we used, as that contains all of our scripts along with brief descriptions of the functions of the code. All one would really need to do would be to download the Automation.ipynb file and then edit the sections in the code that are specific to our rubric and usage for the assignment, such as editing the email and password in part 2 of the Alert Generation section.

# Usage
To use these scripts and analyze the data, one would only need to change the file being referenced for log analysis (Windows_2k.log_structured.csv) to whatever log files they are trying to use. They can then edit the filters to determine which logs they deem suspicious.
